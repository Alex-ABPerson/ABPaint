# ABPaint
An open-source paint program that is designed to ensure that the user does not need to manually create layers etc.

This paint program is designed to ensure you do not need to worry about Bitmap things but using Vectors.

However, this program isn't just a Vector program - it is designed to work with Bitmaps SEAMLESSLY AS WELL.

## Vectors

Obviously as said above, ABPaint is all about the ability of drawing things each time you refresh rather then it being stored in a Bitmap.

The application uses "Elements" which you can move around, resize and easily manipulate with the properties panel.

The big thing (for me) is the fact that you can draw a Rectangle and change it's colour later in about 1 second!

## Bitmaps

NOTE: RIGHT NOW, BITMAPS ARE NOT SUPPORTED

People have bitmaps everywhere and they will want to take existing bitmaps or put something into a Bitmap to achieve a certain effect. And that's fine - there are lots of traditional Bitmap tool for you to use. For Example: "Bitmap Selection Tool" which allows you to drag a selection, "Magic Wand Tool" which allows you to select an area with a color in one single click!

You don't have to use Bitmaps but if you have to or want to for a certain thing you can do so.

## More coming soon!
