# ABPaint
ABPaint is an open-source paint program that is designed to ensure that the user does not need to manually create layers etc.

This paint program is designed to ensure you do not need to worry about bitmap things by using Vectors.

However, this program isn't just a vector program - it is designed to work with bitmaps **seamlessly as well**.

## Vectors

Obviously as said above, ABPaint is all about the ability of drawing things each time you refresh rather then it being stored in a bitmap.

The application uses "Elements" which you can move around, resize and easily manipulate with the properties panel.

The big thing (for me) is that that you can draw a rectangle and change it's colour later!

#### Advantages of vectors over bitmaps:

- You can easily change parts of an object after you have created it.
- You can easily move an object around with all the others as everything is seperate.
- No need to have to manage lots of layers and I've seen projects where you even have to put essentially a mini file system into your layers to manage them!
- You can resize the object/entire canvas without losing **any quality**!

## Bitmaps

**NOTE: RIGHT NOW, BITMAPS ARE NOT SUPPORTED**

People have bitmaps everywhere and they will want to take existing bitmaps or put something into a Bitmap to achieve a certain effect. That's fine - ABPaint has lots of traditional bitmap tools for you to use.

Here are some bitmap tools the program has:
- Bitmap Selection Tool - which allows you to drag a selection
- Magic Wand Tool - which allows you to select an area with a certain colour in one click

You don't have to use Bitmaps but if you have to (or want to for a certain effect) you can do so.

#### Advantages of bitmaps over vectors:

- You can do much more complicated shapes.
- Certain effects can only be achieved with Bitmaps - like making a mask around some text with the fill tool, for example.
- It's better for producing pixel art in than vectors are (trust me, I've tried).

## How do I use it?

At this current point of time there are no guides released ***publicly***, however, when there are they should appear on the official website - http://www.abworld.ml, check the website for updates regularly.

## History

Undoing, redoing and keeping track of work is (*or will be*) easy with ABPaint! Undoing and redoing doesn't use much memory at all - no need to worry!

The last five undos are stored in the file so that you can undo big events (can be disabled for all or certain files).

You can mark certain changes as important so that you can revert to them no matter how many times you undo and redo.

Once again, for a tutorial on all of this - simply check the website - http://abworld.ml
