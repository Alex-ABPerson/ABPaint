# ABPaint
An open-source paint program that is designed to ensure that the user does not need to manually create layers etc.

This paint program is designed to ensure you do not need to worry about bitmap things but using Vectors.

However, this program isn't just a vector program - it is designed to work with bitmaps SEAMLESSLY AS WELL.

## Vectors

Obviously as said above, ABPaint is all about the ability of drawing things each time you refresh rather then it being stored in a bitmap.

The application uses "Elements" which you can move around, resize and easily manipulate with the properties panel.

The big thing (for me) is the fact that you can draw a Rectangle and change it's colour later in about 1 second!

#### Advantages of vectors over bitmaps:

- You can easily change parts of an object after you have created it.
- You can easily move an object around with all the others as everything is seperate.
- No need to have to manage lots of layers and I've seen projects where you even have to put a mini file system into your layers to manage them!
- You can resize the object/entire canvas without losing ANY QUALITY!

## Bitmaps

NOTE: RIGHT NOW, BITMAPS ARE NOT SUPPORTED

People have bitmaps everywhere and they will want to take existing bitmaps or put something into a Bitmap to achieve a certain effect. And that's fine - there are lots of traditional bitmap tools for you to use.

Here are some bitmap tools the program has:
- "Bitmap Selection Tool" which allows you to drag a selection
- "Magic Wand Tool" which allows you to select an area with a color in one single click!

You don't have to use Bitmaps but if you have to or want to for a certain thing you can do so.

#### Advantages of bitmaps over vectors:

- You can do much more complicated shapes.
- Certain effects can only be achieved with Bitmaps - like making a mask around some text with the fill tool, for example.
- It's better for producing pixel art in then vectors are.

## How do I use it?

As of now there is not website however when there is there will be a link here for full in-depth detail on it, with a search feature etc.

## What does the license say?

This project is licensed under the MIT license. Read the LICENSE file for it in-depth. 

It essentially says that you are allowed to use this software, redistribute it, modify it and decompile it (because it's already open source)

You CAN NOT, however, claim it as yours...

AND THERE IS NO WARRANTY (Because I need to put that out there.)

## More coming soon!
